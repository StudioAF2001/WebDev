      <h1><b><u>BTE Project</u></b></h1>
      <p>In the summer of 2019, a YouTuber named FTSPippen uploaded a video calling all<br>
      Minecraft players around the world to come together to create a 1:1 scale<br>
      representation of the world in Minecraft. This is by far the largest community<br>
      project ever undertaken in the games history......and I'm a part of it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So when I was in sixth year, a few months before the project was announced <br>
      I had a taken a keen interest in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster that <br>
      took place in April of 1986 in Ukraine due to my study of nuclear physics in my <br>
      physics class. A few months later, Pippen put the word out and I knew what <br>
      I was going to do</p>
      <br>
      <p>I trawled through the subreddit for the project, only to find to my delight that <br>
      no one had claimed the rights to build the Power Plant. I, along with a good friend, set<br>
      to work. Over the following weeks, many enthusiastic builders joined our endavour to recreate<br>
      the once great power plant in Minecraft. At the same time, the project as a whole was taking <br>
      the gaming community of the internet by storm. At the time of writing, the Discord server that<br>
      is the main hub for the project has a total of 240,000 members</p>
      <br>
      <p>So far, we have done an incredible job in doing our part of the project to the best of our ability.<br>
      We will continue to carry out this monumental task in the hopes that one day, no matter how much <br>
      the world around us changes, people can still go back to this project to see what the world looked like<br>
      back then and have the chance to walk around in it.</p>

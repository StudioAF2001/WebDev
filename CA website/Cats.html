    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <p>I have owned many cats in my life, but none have ever been as special as the cat<br>
    that I own now. Sure, they were all amazing to have, but none of them stuck around as <br>
    long as Mittens has. Yes, that's his name (I named him when I was like 9, so no wonder)<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My family got Mittens when I was only about 9 years old, back in 2010. He was only<br>
    a tiny kitten yet, just like any other kitten, he was full of life and energy. These <br>
    days, he's the much more dosile type. He chills out in his bed or on chairs most of the day<br>
    and sometimes goes out for the occasion hunt and play. Unsurprising considering he's<br>
    around 12 years old </p>
    <br>
    <p>He is by far the best tempered cat I have met up to now and I couldn't ask for more.<br>
    Here's a few pictures of him so you can appreciate him too</p>

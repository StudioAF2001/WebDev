        <p style="padding-left: 22%;">
        My favourite hobby is to build and resarch PC's and their parts<br>
        I'm currently in the process of designing and building my own personal<br>
        desktop PC so I will tell you a bit more about that.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 22%;">
        In my home-designed, home-built PC, I have chosen then AMD Ryzen 5 3600 <br>
        as my processor. At the time of writing this, it is one of te best price for<br>
        performance processor on the market for gaming as well as just overall usage. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 22%; padding-right: 17%;">
        For my motherboard, I have chosen an ASUS ROG Strix b450f gaming. It provides<br>
        good performance and upgradability for a decent price, along well a good I/O. <br>
        It will allow me to upgrade my BIOS to allow for an upgrade in CPU to the Ryzen Zen 3<br>
        platform. and best of all, it has RGB!!</p>
        <br>
        <img src="resources/MyCase.jpg" alt="My PC case" style="width:20%; height:20%; float:right;">
        <p style="padding-left: 22%;">
        I'll keep the RAM specs short and to the point. I have purchased 16GB of 3600MHz<br>
        DDR4 Corsair Vengeance RGB. The high speed will be perfect for the AMD architecture<br>
        for extremely fast communication between the RAM and the CPU.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="padding-left: 22%;">
        For my case, I have chosen the Corsair 4000d airflow. It is an mid-ATX case that has<br>
        good airflow from the corrugated front panel and the tempered glass side panel prodes<br>
        a look inside the machine. It has a decent front I/O, plenty sufficient for daily use.<br>
        The picture across is my case.

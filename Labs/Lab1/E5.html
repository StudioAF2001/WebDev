The IT Carlow Medical Centre is Nurse led and available to all full-time registered students and apprentices throughout the academic year.
The service is provided as a term time addition rather than a replacement for the student's own GP and is intended
to provide acute care doring the week when it is not possible for students to attend their own Medical Practice.
The service provides treatment and referrals to community services, and promotes positive well-being through advice,
information and health promotion. The college Nurse Theresa Lowry-Lehnen is available for the assessment,
treatment and management of students' health needs during the term and for the management of any 1llness or condition
